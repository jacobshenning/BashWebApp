# [](#header-1)Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## [](#header-2)Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### [](#header-3)Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dd>Japan</dd>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

# Bash Web App

Welcome to the Bash Web App documentation.

We don't have a lot of docs so far, but that's because this is a relatively new repository.

## How to Install

If you want to know how to install this thing, this is the section for you!

1. Do something
2. Do more things
3. Do a ton of things!

<p>In addition to the changes in the previous section, certain references are auto-linked:</p>

</ul>

<p>These are dangerous goodies though, and we need to make sure email addresses don't get mangled:</p>

<p>My email addy is <a href="mailto:tom@github.com">tom@github.com</a>.</p>

## How to Use

This is how you use this thing!

<p>In first grade I learned that 5 &gt; 3 and 2 &lt; 7. Maybe some arrows. 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3. 9 &lt;- 8 &lt;- 7.</p>

<p>Triangles man! a^2 + b^2 = c^2</p>

<h2>We all like making lists</h2>

<p>The above header should be an H2 tag. Now, for a list of fruits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Red Apples</li>
<li>Purple Grapes</li>
<li>Green Kiwifruits</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's get crazy:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor<br>
sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit<br>
mi posuere lectus.</p>

<p>Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet<br>
vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum<br>
sit amet velit.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What about some code <strong>in</strong> a list? That's insane, right?</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>In Ruby you can map like this:</p>

<pre><code>['a', 'b'].map { |x| x.uppercase }</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Rails, you can do a shortcut:</p>

<pre><code>['a', 'b'].map(&amp;:uppercase)</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Some people seem to like definition lists</p>

<dl>
<dt>Lower cost</dt>
<dd>The new version of this product costs significantly less than the previous one!</dd>
<dt>Easier to use</dt>
<dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>
</dl>

<h2>I am a robot</h2>

<p>Maybe you want to print <code>robot</code> to the console 1000 times. Why not?</p>

<pre><code>def robot_invasion
puts("robot " * 1000)
end
</code></pre>

<p>You see, that was formatted as code because it's been indented by four spaces.</p>

<p>How about we throw some angle braces and ampersands in there?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="footer"&gt;
&amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Set in stone</h2>

<p>Preformatted blocks are useful for ASCII art:</p>

<pre>             ,-.
,     ,-.   ,-.
/ \   (   )-(   )
\ |  ,.&gt;-(   )-&lt;
\|,' (   )-(   )
Y ___`-'   `-'
|/__/   `-'
|
|
|    -hrr-
___|_____________
</pre>

<h2>Playing the blame game</h2>

<p>If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I<br>
could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in<br>
the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to<br>
come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>

<p>I don't want to sound like<br>
I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you<br>
just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet<br>
as I should be in coming up with one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Table for two</h2>

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>ID</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Rank</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Tom Preston-Werner</td>
<td>Awesome</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Albert Einstein</td>
<td>Nearly as awesome</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
