# :tada: Bash Web App :tada:

## Welcome to the Bash Web App docs

The Bash Web App is an emulation of a Bash Unix Shell, and focuses more on the UX journey, making the content more memorable.

> Why a Bash Web App? Aren't there other ways to get users attention?

Sure, you can throw up some fancy designs to wow your users, but then again, so can everyone else. If you want to stand out, you have to do something different, but this will only work if your audience will understand what you're doing.

### So should you use the Bash Web App?

Well, only you can answer that, but if it helps, here is a list of uses we had in mind when making it.

1. Recruiting Developers

    Most developers use their shell on a daily basis, whether it is testing locally, downloading dependencies, or updating their repos. By using a shell web application to reach out to them, you'll be speaking their language :+1:

2. Getting Hired

    Are you a developer? Do you want a job? Get hired by showing off your creative interpretation of the Bash Shell. :sunglasses:

3. Teaching Newbies

    Lets face it, sometimes that "```help```" command in the shell isn't that helpful :confused:... But hey, don't sweat it, our Bash Web App is easy, intuitive, and a great stepping stone for those who aren't used to operating in the shell.

### Getting Started?

Err, well, here is the thing. We too are just getting started, and so we don't have all of our features or support up and running yet. We're missing things like

- How to Use
- Installation
- Documentation

But, we do have things like

- [How to get involved](#getting-involved-1tada)
- [Contributing guide][1]

and we would love for you to get onboard with use!
