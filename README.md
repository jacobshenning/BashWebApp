# :tada: Bash Web App :tada:

## What is the Bash Web App? :thinking:

The Bash Web App is an easy to learn online shell that anyone can pickup and use. If you're not sure what a shell is, read our [What is Shell? page](/page) to get a quick understanding of the shell and how it works. 

***But why?***

Because often times, its the *journey* that makes an experience, and not just the destination. By creating an application which requires the user to navigate via **old school bash commands**, we're creating a journey that will leave a solid impression in the users day.
