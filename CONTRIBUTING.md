# Contributing Guidelines for Console

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project, which is hosted by [jacobshenning](https://github.com/jacobshenning) on [GitHub](https://github.com). These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

### Requirements

While this is a pretty easy going repository, everyone who participates is required to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/jacobshenning/console/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold these rules. Report misconduct to jacobshenning@gmail.com

### Style Guide

Our current style guide for comments, issues, and communication in general is pretty non-specific. This of course,  will change overtime. For now, just use your best judgement and rely on the [README](https://github.com/jacobshenning/console/blob/master/README.md)
